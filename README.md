# Linear Search Using Multiple Programming Paradigms (Python)

This project demonstrates how the Linear Search algorithm can be implemented using different programming paradigms in Python. It is part of a course project to understand how the same algorithm behaves when structured differently.


# Files Included

- **linear search using iterative.py**  
  Implements Linear Search using a basic `for` loop.

- **linear search using recursive.py**  
  Implements Linear Search using a recursive function.

- **linear search using functions.py**  
  Breaks down the logic into reusable functions for modularity.

- **linear search using OOP.py**  
  Uses Object-Oriented Programming with a class and method.


# How to Run

- Make sure Python 3.10 or above is installed.
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Run any of the files using:

  ```bash
  python "linear search using iterative.py"
